## Ladybug

The ladybug is floating in the air. Decimals ainâ€™t no secret for it.

### Tutorial

You can ask the ladybug to move somewhere:

```
m 2.5,2.5
```

To draw a vertical line:

```
v2.5
```

And a horizontal one:

```
h2.5
```

Or any line:

```
l -2.5,-2.1
```

And finally ask the larva to completely close
the current drawing path:

```
Z
```

The ladybug can draw dotted lines:

```
m 2.5,2.5
h 0.5 m 0.5,0 h0.5 m0.5,0 h0.5 m0.5,0 h0.5
m0,0.5 v0.5 m0,0.5 v0.5 m0,0.5 v0.5
```
