## Larva

The larvae canâ€™t fly yet, but they still have some
tricks to show.

## Tutorial

You can ask the larva to move somewhere:
```
m 5,5
```

To draw a vertical line:
```
v5
```

And a horizontal one:
```
h5
```

Or any line:
```
l -5,-1
```

And finally ask the larva to completely close
 the current drawing path:
```
Z
```

You may want to draw directly by using the absolute
commands:
```
M5,5 H10 V10 h-5 v-5 L2,2 L3,2 Z
M5,5L4,2 L5,2 Z
M10,10 H14 V14 h-4Z
```
