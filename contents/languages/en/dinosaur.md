## Dinosaur

The dinosaurs disappeared. Guess why!

### Tutorial

You can ask the dinosaur to move somewhere:
```
m 5,5
```

To draw a vertical line:
```
v10
```

And a horizontal one:
```
h10
```

You may want to draw stairs by mixing commands:
```
m7,7 h5 v5 h5 v5 h2 v3 h2 v3
```

And eventually use absolute commands:
```
M5,5 V10 H10
```
