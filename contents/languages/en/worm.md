## Worm

The worms survived to dinosaurs, they probably
knew relative numbers!

### Tutorial

You can ask the worm to move somewhere:
```
m 5,5
```

To draw a vertical line:
```
v-3
```

And a horizontal one:
```
h-3
```

You may want to draw directly by using the absolute
commands:
```
M5,5 H10 V10 h-5 v-5
```

Letâ€™s draw a worm:
```
m 5,5
v10
h10
M5,5 H10 V10 h-5 v-5
m1,1 h1 v1 h-1 v-1
m2,0 h1 v1 h-1 v-1
M7,8 h1
```
